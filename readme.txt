A distraction-free environment for blogging; inspired by Habari, OmmWriter, WriteRoom, and countless wasted hours of staring at blank screens.

== Description ==

A distraction-free environment for blogging; inspired by Habari, OmmWriter, WriteRoom, and the countless wasted hours I've spent staring at blank screens.

If you're a fan of [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom), [OmmWriter](http://www.ommwriter.com/), or similar tools that help you focus on your words instead of the tools you're using, this plugin will soon make your wildest dreams come true (and give you a simple clean environment to write to your heart's content)! 

While Zen does not replace the existing Edit Post/Page screen, it provides a layer on top that allows you to focus on your writing. You get an input box for the title a regular ol' textbox to add your post (feel free to use HTML).

NOTE: Zen requires PHP 5+. Not on PHP 5 yet? Talk to your hosting provider and get them to upgrade! You can thank me later.

If you're a designer (or even just a regular Jane or Joe) and have any ideas for themes, please [get in touch](mailto:batmoo@gmail.com)! I'd love to add it to Zen!

If you have any ideas for Zen or features you'd like to see included, please [get in touch](mailto:batmoo@gmail.com)!

Zen was inspired by [this post on Habari](http://ifranky.com/2010/01/wordpress-vs-bloat/) by [ifranky](http://ifranky.com/).

Special thanks to [Andrew Spittle](http://andrewspittle.net) for helping me out the with theme designs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and extract the plugin to plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Specify your preferred options under Users > Your Profile
1. Enjoy writing with WordPress once again (okay, okay, you always enjoyed writing with WordPress. Just enjoy it a little more okay?)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I use the HTML or visual editors in Zen mode? =

There's an issue with the HTML editor that's breaks Zen. You get a simple ol' textarea instead. Which, you know, may actually be better. Just sayin'...

= What browsers does Zen support? =

For best results, use a browser that supports basic CSS3. That includes Firefox 3.6+, Chrome 3+, Safari 4+, IE9+. Other browsers should work too, including IE, but will not have as awesome an experience.

== Screenshots ==

1. Zen gets rid of all the unnecessary modules on the Edit Post/Page screen and gives you the bare minimum needed to write.
2. Zen adds a quick-access button to launch Zen mode from your Edit Post screen.
3. Zen has a couple of options 
4. Zen provides multiple themes that can be easily switched on-the-fly using a keyboard shortcut.
5. Zen Dark Theme
6. Zen Sunset Theme
7. Zen Terminal Theme
